# XSLOPE

This semester we will be using a special Python package called `xslope`. XSLOPE is a free and open-source Python package that is designed to be used in seepage and slope stability analysis. The documentation for XSLOPE can be found at: [xslope.org](https://xslope.org/){target='_blank'}.

XSLOPE can be installed using `pip`:

```
pip install xslope
```

We will typically use XSLOPE via a set of custom Colab notebooks:

Links to these notebooks will be posted on the course website in selected exercises and homework asssignments.
