# Syllabus

## Course Objectives

As the name implies, we will cover two main topics: seepage and slope stability. The two topics are related since seepage and slope stability analyses are often done in tandem.

Seepage analysis can take many forms, but the type of analysis we will be doing in this class is the analysis of seepage through vertical profiles, i.e., vertical cross-sections through dams, levees, embankments, etc. We will look at analytical solutions, graphical solutions (flow nets), and numerical solutions (both finite difference and finite element analysis). We will also look at the uses wells for construction dewatering.

Slope stability analysis is the process of analyzing slopes and embankments to determine the factor of safety against slope failure. It is routinely performed on dams, levees, excavations (cuts for highways, etc.), mine tailings, and embankments. Most stability analyses are performed with the aid of a specialized computer program, but we will look at simple cases that can be solved with charts, equations, or spreadsheets.

## Course Outcomes

After successfully completing this course, you should:

1. Be able to apply Darcy's law to solve basic problems related to flow through porous media.
2. Understand the governing equations for 2D and 3D groundwater flow, including what simplifying assumptions are used 
   in the derivation of the equations.
3. Be able to create and interpret graphical solutions (flow nets) to the governing equations.
4. Be able to apply analytical solutions to the governing equations, including well equations.
5. Be able to apply analytical solutions to construction dewatering problems.
6. Understand the finite difference solution and be able to create finite difference solutions in Excel.
7. Understand how the finite element method works and how the finite element equations are formulated.
8. Be able to apply finite element software to solve complex seepage analysis problems.
9. Understand the basic concepts of the limit equilibrium method of slope stability.
10. Be able to apply slope stability charts for simple problems.
11. Be able to apply slope stablity software (such as UTEXAS) for common slope stablility problems.
12. Be able to solve special cases of slope stability including, reinforced slopes, rapid drawdown, and seismic 
    conditions.

## Lecture Format

The course will be taught in a hybrid format. The lectures will be pre-recorded and available on Youtube. The youtube videos will generally be broken into 10-15 minute segments. A link to the videos associated with each lecture will be provided on the Learning Suite schedule. You should watch the lectures prior to the class period. For the slope stability portion of the class, there will also be assigned reading. The class period will be used for discussing the lecture video content and working through exercises together. 

## Quizzes

There will be pre-class quiz associated with each lecture where you can report if you have completed watching the video and doing the assigned reading. There will also be a few simple questions on the content. The quizzes will be on Learning Suite and will be due 30 minutes prior to class.

## Exams

Exams will be given on-line. You will have a 2-3 days to take the exam. The exam will be timed and you will have 3 hours to complete it. The exam will be closed book, closed notes, and closed internet. You may not discuss the exam with anyone else until the exam period is over. You may not use any other person to help you with the exam. You may not use any other person's work as your own.

Since we are covering two distinct topics, there will be two exams. The first exam will cover the seepage portion of the class and the second exam will cover the slope stability portion.

## Policies

In most cases, the homework will be due at midnight one week from the day it is assigned. All homework should be submitted via Learning Suite. Late homework will be reduced 10% each day that it is late (not including Saturdays and Sundays) up to a maximum penalty of 50%. Late homework will always be worth at least 50%. Late penalties may be waived under extreme circumstances such as illness or travel. Forgetting to upload your completed assignment, uploading the wrong assignment, etc. are not extreme circumstances.

No late homework will be accepted after midnight on the last day of the semester (first day prior to reading days).

There will be one midterm exams and a final exam. The first exam will cover the seepage portion of the class and the second exam will cover the slope stability portion. Both exams will be given on-line. There will be no make-up exams. All exams must be taken in one of the CAEDM labs.

If I discover that you have cheated on one of my exams, I will give you a failing grade for the course and refer you to the BYU Honor Code Office.
I encourage you to work together on the homework as long as everyone is contributing and learning. You may not simply copy one another's work. You may not copy old homework. You must understand the lectures and the homework in order to perform well on the exams

For the slope stability section, there will be a set of quizzes associated with the reading. The quizzes are on Learning Suite and should be completed prior to class.

## Grades

Grades will be assigned based on the following formula. See Learning Suite for a complete list of scores and grades.

| Item | Percentage |
|------|------------|
| Homework | 25% |
| Case Study | 7% |
| Exam #1 | 30% |
| Exam #2 | 30% |
| Quizzes | 8% |
| Total | 100% |

## Microsoft Teams

There will be a **Micorsoft Teams** group for this class. You will be invited to join the group by the instructor. The group will be used for announcements, discussions, and questions. You are encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions. We will also use the group for virtual office hours. I can jump on video chat to help you with your homework or answer questions.

You can access Teams through the web interface or by downloading the app to your computer or phone. You should get in the habit of checking the group regularly for announcements and discussions. You can also set up notifications to be alerted when there is new activity in the group.

## Textbooks

**Required**: _Soil Strength and Slope Stability, 2nd Edition_, Duncan, Wright, and Brandon

We will use text primarily during the second part of the semester. You can access this textbook for free through the BYU library as described in the [Textbook](./textbook.md) section.

**Optional**: _Construction Dewatering and Groundwater Control_, Powers, Et al.

Good reference on dewatering issues

**Optional**: _Seepage, Drainage, and Flow Nets_, Cedergren.

Good, but dated. Last edition published in 1997.
