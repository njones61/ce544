# UTEXASED Installation

This semester we are using the student edition of UTEXAS, called UTEXASED4. This software is pre-installed on all of the computers in room 234. You may also download and install a copy of UTEXASED on your laptop or personal computer provided that it be used only for academic work associated with this class and that you do not forward it to anyone not enrolled in the class.

## Software
There are two files that you need:

(1) [UTEXASED4.zip](UTEXASED4.zip)

Download this copy to your local drive and unzip it into a local folder. There is no formal installation utility.

(2) UTEXASED4.SSR

Send a message to the Dr. Jones to get a copy of this file.

This file is related to the copy protection. You should place one copy in the same folder as the UTEXASED executable and save a virgin copy of the file (it is modified each time you run UTEXASED) in a separate directory in case your other copy gets messed up.

Launch the Utexas Educational.exe file and you should be good to go.

NOTE: This should work fine on your laptops or home computers. On a CAEDM drive, you may need to copy a fresh version of the *.SSR file into the folder with the executable each time you launch it.
