# Pre-Class - Governing Equations

In this video we will use Darcy's Law and conservation of mass to derive a set of governing equations that we can use to solve for the flow of water in a porous media. We will explore the 2D and 3D forms of the equation and discuss how the equations are solved in a numerical model.
