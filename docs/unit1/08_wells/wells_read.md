# Pre-Class - Well Equations

This video introduces the equations used to calculate the flow rate through a well and to compute the drawdown at the well and the head (h) as a function of distance (x) from the well. The video also explains how to use these equations to calculate the hydraulic conductivity and/or transmissivity of an aquifer.
