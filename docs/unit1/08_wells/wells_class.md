# Exercise - Well Equations

## Part 1 - Radius of Influence

The radius of influence of a well is the distance from the well at which the drawdown is negligible. The radius of influence can be estimated using the following equations:

| Name      | Type | Equation                         |
|-----------|------|----------------------------------|
| Lembke    |Semi-Empirical| $R = H\sqrt{\frac{k}{2N}}$       | 
| Weber     | Semi-Empirical | $R = 2.45\sqrt{\frac{Hkt}{n_e}}$ |
| Kusakin   | Semi-Empirical | $R = 1.9\sqrt{\frac{Hkt}{n_e}}$  |
| Siechardt | Empirical | $R = 3000s_w\sqrt{k}$            |
| Kusakin   | Empirical | \(R = 575s_w\sqrt{\frac{H}{k}}\) |

Where:

>>H = initial thickness (B for confined aquifers, h for unconfined aquifers) [m]<br>
k = hydraulic conductivity [m/sec]<br>
$s_w$ = drawdown at the well [m]<br>
\(n_e\) = effective porosity (storativity S, for confined) [-]<br>
t = time since pumping began [sec]<br>
N = accretion from rainfall [m/sec]

The following spreadsheet a sample set of calculations for each of the equations above.

## Part 2 - Confined Aquifer

In this exercise, you will calculate the water level at the center of the well and as a function of distance from the well for a confined aquifer.

The following equations can be used to calculate the head (h) as a function of distance (x) from the well:

$$
h =  H = \frac{q}{2\pi k D} \ln\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)
$$

Where:

>>h = head [L]<br>
H = initial head prior to pumping [L]<br>
q = flow rate [L続/T]<br>
k = hydraulic conductivity [L/T]<br>
D = thickness of the confined aquifer [L]<br>
r = distance from the well [L]<br>
R = radius of influence of the well [L]

Assume the following values for the confined aquifer:

| Parameter | Value | Units |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| H         | 50    | m     |
| Q         | 0.2   | m続/s  |
| k         | 1e-3  | m/s   |
| D         | 15    | m     |
| R         | 500   | m     |
| \(r_w\)   | 0.1   | m     |

a) Calculate the head at the center of the well (r = \(r_w\)).

b) Let r vary from rw to R. Calculate and plot the head as a function of distance (r) from the well.

## Part 3 - Unconfined Aquifer

In this exercise, you will calculate the water level at the center of the well and as a function of distance from the well for an unconfined aquifer.

![unconfined.png](unconfined.png)

The following equations can be used to calculate the head (h) as a function of distance (x) from the well:

$$
h =  \sqrt{H^2 - \frac{q \ln\left(\frac{R}{r}\right)}{\pi k} }
$$

Where:
h = head [L]<br>
H = initial head prior to pumping [L]<br>
q = flow rate [L続/T]<br>
R = radius of influence of the well [L]<br>
r = distance from the well [L]<br>
k = hydraulic conductivity [L/T]<br>

Assume the following values for the unconfined aquifer:

| Parameter | Value | Units |
|-----------|----|-------|
| Q         | 0.2 | m続/s  |
| k         | 1  | cm/s  |
| H         | 50 | m     |
| R         | 500 | m     |
| \(r_w\)   | 0.1 | m     |

a) Calculate the head at the center of the well (r = \(r_w\)).

b) Let r vary from rw to R. Calculate and plot the head as a function of distance (r) from the well.
