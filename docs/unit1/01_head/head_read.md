# Pre-Class - Hydraulic Head Concepts

This video introduces the concept of hydraulic head, which is a fundamental concept in groundwater flow. Hydraulic 
head is a measure of the potential energy of water in an aquifer. The video explains the components of hydraulic 
head and how it relates to pressure and elevation and groundwater flow.

This video was originally developed for CE 547 - Groundwater Modeling at Brigham Young University. But the 
content is applicable to our 
course as well.
