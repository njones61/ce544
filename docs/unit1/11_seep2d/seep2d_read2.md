# Pre-Class - The Finite Element Method

The finite element method (FEM) is a numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is a powerful tool for solving a wide range of engineering problems, including structural analysis, heat transfer, fluid flow, and many others. The FEM divides a complex problem into smaller, simpler elements, which are then connected to form a mesh. The solution is approximated by solving the equations for each element and combining them to obtain the overall solution.

In this set of videos, we will explore the basics of the finite element method and its application to seepage problems. We will explore the formulation of the finite element equations in both one and two dimensions and will review how finite element meshes are constructed.
