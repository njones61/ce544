# Pre-Class - Introduction to SEEP2D

SEEP2D is a two-dimensional finite element model for simulating seepage problems in porous media. It is a powerful tool for simulating seepage problems in earth dams, levees, embankments, and other earth structures. SEEP2D was originally developed by the US Army Corps of Engineers HEC-RAS software package. It is a versatile tool that can be used to analyze a wide range of seepage problems.
