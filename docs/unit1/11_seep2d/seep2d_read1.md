# Pre-Class - Introduction to SEEP2D

SEEP2D is a two-dimensional finite element model for simulating seepage problems in porous media. It is a powerful tool for simulating seepage problems in earth dams, levees, embankments, and other earth structures. In this video, we will introduce the SEEP2D model and its capabilities.
