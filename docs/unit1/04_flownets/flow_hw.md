# Homework - Flow Nets

Consider the following cross section:

![sheetpilefig.gif](sheetpilefig.gif)

Water flows from the left to the right through the silty soil (tan color). The dual sheetpiles penetrate halfway through the silt and are filled with a relatively impermeable material. The objective of this assignment is to find a solution to the seepage through the silt using the flow net method. We will then calculate the flow rate through the silt and calculate pore pressures at selected locations.
