# Pre-Class - Darcy's Law

This video introduces Darcy's Law, which is a fundamental equation in groundwater flow. Darcy's Law describes the flow of water through porous media, such as soil or rock. The video explains the components of Darcy's Law and how it is used to calculate groundwater flow rates.

This video was originally developed for CE 547 - Groundwater Modeling at Brigham Young University. But the 
content is applicable to our 
course as well.
