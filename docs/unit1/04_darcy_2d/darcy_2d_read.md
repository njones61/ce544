# Pre-Class - Darcy's Lay in Multi-Dimensional Systems

This video introduces Darcy's Law in multi-dimensional systems. It illustrates how to calculate the flow of water through a 2D system where the hydraulic conductivity is not constant. The lecture explains how to derive a separate equation for Darcy's Law representing flow in the X, Y, and Z direction and then combine those equations into a matix format which we will later use to develop the governing equations for a numerical model to solve for the flow rates in the system. The video also explains how to handle cases where the hydraulic conductivity is not constant in the X and Y directions and where the bedding planes are not aligned with the orthogonal (X,Y,Z) axes.

This video was originally developed for CE 547 - Groundwater Modeling at Brigham Young University. But the content is applicable to our course as well.
