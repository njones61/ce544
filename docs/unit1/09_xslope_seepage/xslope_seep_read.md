# Pre-Class - Introduction to XSLOPE

XSLOPE is a python package for seepage and slope stability analysis. We will use XSLOPE to simulate seepage problems in porous media using the finite element method. In the next unit, we will use XSLOPE to perform slope stability analysis. 

For this lecture, there is no recorded video. Rather, I would like you to carefully read the following parts of the XSLOPE documentation:
