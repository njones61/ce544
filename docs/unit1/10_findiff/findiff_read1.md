# The Finite Difference Method, Part 1

In this lesson, we will introduce the finite difference method (FDM) and how it can be used to solve seepage problems. The FDM is a numerical method that approximates the solution to a differential equation by discretizing the domain into a grid of points and approximating the derivatives at each point using finite differences. We will also introduce how to use an Excel spreadsheet to solve seepage problems using the FDM.
