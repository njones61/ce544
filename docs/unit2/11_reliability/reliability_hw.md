# Homework - Reliability Analysis

Consider the following slope:

![hw_fig.png](hw_fig.png)

Each of the non-zero parameters have been anayzed and a standard deviation has been estimated for each as follows:

| Parameter  | MLV | $\sigma$ |
|:----------:|:---:|:--------:|
|  $\phi_1$  | 30  |   4.5    |
|   $c_1$    | 100 |    20    |
| $\gamma_1$ | 125 |   9.1    |
|   $Su_2$   | 700 |   150    |
| $\gamma_1$ | 115 |   7.2    |

Perform a reliability analysis on the slope to find both the reliability (R) and probability of failure (Pf). Use the Taylor Series Method to find COVF and perform your slope stability calculations using UTEXASED. Summarize all of your calculations in a spreadsheet.

## Submission

Zip up a copy of your UTEXASED input file (with MLV parameters) and the spreadsheet into a single zip archive. Upload your zip archive via Learning Suite after we grade it together in class.

## Grading Rubric

Self-grade your assignment using the following rubric. Enter your points in the "Submission notes" section for the assignment on Learning Suite when you upload your file. You can use fractional points if you like (e.g. 2.5).

| Criteria                                    | Points |
|---------------------------------------------|:------:|
| Completed on time and all or mostly correct |   3    |
| Completed more than half of assignment      |   2    |
| Made an effort                              |   1    |
