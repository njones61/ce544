# Pre-Class - Seismic Slope Stability Analysis

In this section, we will introduce the concept of seismic slope stability analysis. When an earthquake occurs, the ground shaking can induce slope failures. We will learn how to assess the stability of slopes under seismic loading conditions and calculate the seismic factor of safety.
