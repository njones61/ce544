# Pre-Class - The Limit Equilibrium Method, Part 1

The Limit Equilibrium Method is a common approach to analyze the stability of slopes. This method is based on the assumption that the slope is in equilibrium when the driving forces are balanced by the resisting forces. The Limit Equilibrium Method is widely used in geotechnical engineering to assess the stability of slopes, embankments, and retaining walls.

In the following reading and videos, we will review the basic concepts of the Limit Equilibrium Method and introduce the factor of safety, which is a key parameter in slope stability analysis. We will also discuss the different types of forces acting on a slope and how they are calculated. We will review the inifinite slope analysis and the method of slices, which are two common approaches to analyze slope stability using the Limit Equilibrium Method.
