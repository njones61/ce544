# Homework - Chart Solutions

Use the Excel solution we used for the class exercise ([link](chart_solution_KEY.xlsx)) and the stability charts for the phi=0 case in the Appendix of the textbook to solve the following problems:

(1) Submerged slope. Remember that $H_w$ should not be greater than H or you will overcompensate the pore pressures.
