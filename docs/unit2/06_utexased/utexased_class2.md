# Exercise - UTEXASED Problems, Part 2

In this exercise, we will solve three additional slope stability problems using the UTEXASED software.

## Problem 1 - Method of Slices Problem

This is the same problem we solved earlier using an Excel spreadsheet. Solve using UTEXASED.

Use the following UTEXASED input file as a starting point:

[multi-layer foundation.input-utexased](multi-layer%20foundation.input-utexased)

## Problem 3 - Non-Circular Failure Surface Problem

Solve the following problem using UTEXASED. Use the non-circular surface option.

**Variations:**

a) Circular failure surface<br>
b) Individual non-circular surface<br>
c) Automatic search non-circular surface
