# Exercise - Stability Analysis with XSLOPE, Part 2

In this exercise, we will solve three additional slope stability problems using the UTEXASED software. For each problem, start with the standard Excel input template:

[input_template.xlsx](https://xslope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/inputs/input_template.xlsx)

After preparing each set of inputs, launch the XSLOPE Google Colab notebook for stability analysis and upload your Excel input file and solve:

Find the critical factor of safety for each problem.

## Problem 1 - Method of Slices Problem

This is the same problem we solved earlier using an Excel spreadsheet. Solve using XSLOPE.

## Problem 2 - Multi-Layer Foundation Problem

Solve the following problem using UTEXASED.

Use a variety of starting circles to ensure that you have found the critical factor of safety.

## Problem 3 - Non-Circular Failure Surface Problem

Solve the following problem using XSLOPE.

**Variations:**

a) Circular failure surface<br>
b) Individual non-circular surface<br>
c) Automatic search non-circular surface
