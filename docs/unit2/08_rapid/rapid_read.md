# Pre-Class - Rapid Drawdown Analysis

For earth dams and levees, rapid drawdown analysis is an important consideration in slope stability analysis. When the water level in a reservoir is lowered rapidly, the pore water pressure in the soil increases, which can lead to slope failure. In this pre-class, we will introduce the concept of rapid drawdown analysis and discuss how it affects slope stability.
