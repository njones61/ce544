This is kind of like a term project or term paper, but a little more low-key. First of all, the case study will be done in groups of 3-4 students. The group assignments are listed below. Everyone is expected to contribute equally to the case study. Each group is expected to find and research a case study that involves seepage, dewatering, and/or slope stability analysis. Not just a slope failure or seepage problem for example, but a case where some sort of analysis was peformed similar to the types of analysis we cover in class. This could be a design project or an investigation into a slope failure or seepage problem. Executive Summary Each group will submit a one-page executive summary of your case study. Include a title, an overview, and a list of references (minimum of three). This should be a high-level summary of the case study and the analysis that was performed. Presentation You will be expected to prepare and deliver a powerpoint presentation to the class. The presentations will be 10-12 minutes long with a few minutes in each case for Q/A. Each person on your team should make part of the presentation. The presentations should be as professional as possible. Try to minimize bulleted lists and focus more on photos, drawings, videos, etc. You will also be expected to prepare a one-page written executive summary of your case study. The presentation files will be due at midnight on the evening prior to the first day of presentations. One person per team should upload the case study presentation. Each of the other members of the team will upload the title slide only(this simplifies my grading process). The title slide should include the group number. Participation In order to encourage full participation in the term project, everyone is required to submit a participation score from 0-100 for each of the fellow members of your group, INCLUDING YOURSELF. The objective is to help ensure that everyone joins in and one member of the group does not unfairly take advantage of the other member(s) by not helping. You will upload a text or Word document or spreadsheet listing the scores for your fellow team members. I will treat this as a scaling factor (percentage-based) and scale the scores accordingly. For example, if your teammates give you a score of 50, and your term project gets a score of 85, your final score would be 0.5*85=42.5. As you assign these scores, please remember that everyone has a different set of talents and abilities. In most cases, I expect to see a score of 100% for everyone. But this is a mechanism to deal with cases where someone does a very light share of the work (or no work at all). Scoring The case study will be worth 7 points. The breakdown is as follows: Item Pts % Participation Score 0.5 7.1% Executive Summary 1.5 21.5% Presentation 5 71.4% Total: 7 100% Groups","title":"Case Study"},{"location":"resources/casestudy/#case-study","text":"This semester we will be doing a case study exercise which will be part of your grade.

GMS was originally developed here at BYU under the direction of Prof. Jones and is now developed, maintained, and distributed by a local company called Aquaveo LLC. MODFLOW is a free and open source groundwater modeling code developed by the United States Geological Survey. To run MODFLOW, you prepare a series of text input files describing your model geometry, boundary conditions, input parameters, etc. MODFLOW reads these files and generates a set of output files. GMS is a pre- and post-processor for MODFLOW. It greatly simplifiies and automated the preparation of the MODFLOW input files, launches MODFLOW, and reads and displays the resulting output files. GMS is available on most of the CAEDM computers. In some labs it runs via a Citrix client, but in room 234 CB, it is installed directly on the local machines and runs very efficiently. If you are on campus, this is a convenient way to access the software. However, there are several options you can use to access GMS off-campus. Installation on Your Personal Computer/Laptop If you have a Windows-based desktop or laptop computer, your best solution is to install your own version of GMS. To do so, download the latest version here: https://www.aquaveo.com/downloads (click on the GMS tab) After installing, you will be prompted to enter a registration code. I will email a code to the entire class that you can use. You will also be able to find the code in the announcements section in Learning Suite. CAEDM RGS Blades CAEDM provides a system for remotely connecting to CAEDM machines called Remote Graphics Software (RGS). This is similar to Citrix, but is especially useful for graphics-intensive software. In my experience, it seems to work better than Citrix. This will allow you to run GMS remotely. Download and installation instructions here: https://caedm.et.byu.edu/wiki/index.php/RGS RGS works on both Windows and Mac platforms. CAEDM LabConnect LabConnect is similar to RGS, but instead of connecting to virtual machine running on a CAEDM server, you are connecting directly to an unused computer in one of the CAEDM labs. https://caedm.et.byu.edu/wiki/index.php/LabConnect Once again, it will allow you to connect from both Windows and Mac platforms.","title":"GMS Software"},{"location":"resources/gms/#gms-software","text":"For the seepaage analysis portion of the class, we will be using the Groundwater Modeling System (GMS).

The two topics are related since seepage and slope stability analyses are often done in tandem. Seepage analysis can take many forms, but the type of analysis we will be doing in this class is the analysis of seepage through vertical profiles, i.e., vertical cross-sections through dams, levees, embankments, etc. We will look at analytical solutions, graphical solutions (flow nets), and numerical solutions (both finite difference and finite element analysis). We will also look at the uses wells for construction dewatering. Slope stability analysis is the process of analyzing slopes and embankments to determine the factor of safety against slope failure. It is routinely performed on dams, levees, excavations (cuts for highways, etc.), mine tailings, and embankments. Most stability analyses are performed with the aid of a specialized computer program, but we will look at simple cases that can be solved with charts, equations, or spreadsheets. Course Outcomes After successfully completing this course, you should: Be able to apply Darcy's law to solve basic problems related to flow through porous media. Understand the governing equations for 2D and 3D groundwater flow, including what simplifying assumptions are used in the derivation of the equations. Be able to create and interpret graphical solutions (flow nets) to the governing equations. Be able to apply analytical solutions to the governing equations, including well equations. Be able to apply analytical solutions to construction dewatering problems. Understand the finite difference solution and be able to create finite difference solutions in Excel. Understand how the finite element method works and how the finite element equations are formulated. Be able to apply finite element software to solve complex seepage analysis problems. Understand the basic concepts of the limit equilibrium method of slope stability. Be able to apply slope stability charts for simple problems. Be able to apply slope stablity software (such as UTEXAS) for common slope stablility problems. Be able to solve special cases of slope stability including, reinforced slopes, rapid drawdown, and seismic conditions. Lecture Format The course will be taught in a hybrid format. The lectures will be pre-recorded and available on Youtube. The youtube videos will generally be broken into 10-15 minute segments. A link to the videos associated with each lecture will be provided on the Learning Suite schedule. You should watch the lectures prior to the class period. For the slope stability portion of the class, there will also be assigned reading. The class period will be used for discussing the lecture video content and working through exercises together. Quizzes There will be pre-class quiz associated with each lecture where you can report if you have completed watching the video and doing the assigned reading. There will also be a few simple questions on the content. The quizzes will be on Learning Suite and will be due 30 minutes prior to class. Exams Exams will be given on-line. You will have a 2-3 days to take the exam. The exam will be timed and you will have 3 hours to complete it. The exam will be closed book, closed notes, and closed internet. You may not discuss the exam with anyone else until the exam period is over. You may not use any other person to help you with the exam. You may not use any other person's work as your own. Since we are covering two distinct topics, there will be two exams. The first exam will cover the seepage portion of the class and the second exam will cover the slope stability portion. Policies In most cases, the homework will be due at midnight one week from the day it is assigned. All homework should be submitted via Learning Suite. Late homework will be reduced 10% each day that it is late (not including Saturdays and Sundays) up to a maximum penalty of 50%. Late homework will always be worth at least 50%. Late penalties may be waived under extreme circumstances such as illness or travel. Forgetting to upload your completed assignment, uploading the wrong assignment, etc. are not extreme circumstances. No late homework will be accepted after midnight on the last day of the semester (first day prior to reading days). There will be one midterm exams and a final exam. The first exam will cover the seepage portion of the class and the second exam will cover the slope stability portion. Both exams will be given on-line. There will be no make-up exams. All exams must be taken in one of the CAEDM labs. If I discover that you have cheated on one of my exams, I will give you a failing grade for the course and refer you to the BYU Honor Code Office. I encourage you to work together on the homework as long as everyone is contributing and learning. You may not simply copy one another's work. You may not copy old homework. You must understand the lectures and the homework in order to perform well on the exams For the slope stability section, there will be a set of quizzes associated with the reading. The quizzes are on Learning Suite and should be completed prior to class. Grades Grades will be assigned based on the following formula. See Learning Suite for a complete list of scores and grades. Item Percentage Homework 25% Case Study 7% Exam #1 30% Exam #2 30% Quizzes 8% Total 100% Microsoft Teams There will be a Micorsoft Teams group for this class. You will be invited to join the group by the instructor. The group will be used for announcements, discussions, and questions. You are encouraged to ask questions and participate in discussions. We will also use the group for virtual office hours. I can jump on video chat to help you with your homework or answer questions. You can access Teams through the web interface or by downloading the app to your computer or phone. You should get in the habit of checking the group regularly for announcements and discussions. You can also set up notifications to be alerted when there is new activity in the group.

Excel starter file: clayliner.xlsx Excel solution: claylinner_key.xlsx Part 2 - Flow Through a Slurry Wall A slurry wall is a type of wall used to prevent groundwater from entering or leaving a site. The wall is constructed by digging a trench and filling it with a slurry of bentonite and water. The bentonite forms a barrier that is impermeable to water. The trench is then filled with concrete to provide structural support. A 3-ft wide by 20-ft deep slurry trench cutoff wall has been constructed as a flow barrier. After the wall was installed and the flow was allowed to equilibrate, the water table elevation on the left was measured at 2 ft below the ground surface. On the right, it was measured at a depth of 16 ft. The hydraulic conductivity of the wall is estimated to be 1e-6 cm/sec. Assume simple one-dimensional flow from left to right through the 18-ft high section of the wall in contact with the water. a) Calculate the amount of water flowing through a 1 ft thick section of the wall (ft^3/day). b) Calculate the travel time for water flowing through the wall.

To find the total flowrate, to into the SEEP2D Display Options dialog and turn on the Total flowrate toggle. It will then be displayed at the top of the main window. Or you can find it in the SEEP2D output file. Write a paragraph summarizing your observations from the exercise.","title":"Homework - SEEP2D Finite Element Model, Confined Conditions"},{"location":"unit1/11_seep2d/seep2d_hw1/#submission","text":"For part two, submit a copy of the k=0.2 m/d version of your GMS project.
